## About

Tinywind started as a small project for personal use. I originally wanted to build out a set of components that I could use on my own personal projects to increase the speed of development and introduce some consistency between projects.

What started as a handful of components eventually turned into a double-handful of components. At that point, I figured I could open-source these components for others to use. 

Despite the name, I would like to continue growing Tinywind and add more components for others to use. All components will remain free, but if you do end up using some of these components on a project of your own and would like to fund the development of future components, please consider [sponsoring me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/ryangjchandler/).
