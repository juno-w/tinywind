## About

Tinywind was started a small side-project. I originally wanted to build out a set of components that I could use on my own personal projects to increase the speed of development.

What started as a handful of components eventually turned into a double-handful of components. At that point, I figured I could open-source these components for others to use, for **free**.

There are no paid components here. Everything will remain free forever.

If you do end up using some of these components on a project of your own and would like to fund the development of future components, please consider [sponsoring me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/ryangjchandler/).
