## Documentation

You don't _need_ to install any packages or plugins for Tinycode to work. Simply "View source" on a component, copy/paste and off you go!

### Recommended plugins

When using Tinywind, I would recommend installing the following Tailwind plugins:

* `@tailwindcss/forms` - better default form styles
* `@tailwindcss/typography` - clean rich-text styles

### JIT

Tinywind does **not** take advantage of Tailwind's JIT (just-in-time compiler) engine as it's still in early development and it can be quite cumbersome for non-JIT users to modify the styles provided by Tinywind.
